      overview="This school is envisioned as a contemporary institutional landmark, where strong linear planning and a layered façade create clarity, identity, and visual rhythm. The combination of exposed brick, concrete bands, and a dynamic screening layer balances openness with control, allowing filtered light and ventilation—an approach aligned with some of the best school environments in India."
      overview2="The design integrates landscape, shaded edges, and a welcoming entrance zone to enhance movement and interaction. Clean proportions and climate-responsive elements ensure comfort and efficiency, resulting in a campus that feels structured, modern, and engaging for everyday learning."
